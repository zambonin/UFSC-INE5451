`let_freq.py` will open any number of files given through arguments and print
the sorted distribution of letter and digram frequencies.

    python let_freq.py foo.in bar.in

A free copy of Victor Hugo's Les Miser√°bles is included for testing purposes.

`enigma.py` is a simple Enigma M3 implementation that doesn't consider a
Steckerbrett for debugging purposes. It's also lacking different component
models such as rotors and reflectors. `enigma_breaker.py` will break a
ciphered text that's long enough through a index of coincidence test.

    python enigma.py FOOBARTEXTTOENCODE

`spn.py` is a simple substitution-permutation network implementation that will
encode any given 16-bit text with a 32-bit key. `spn_breaker.py` is a
probabilistic differential attack that will try to find, through differential
trails, the right subkey for the given information. It's a functional
representation of the differential attack explained on Douglas Stinson's
Cryptography: Theory and Practice, 2nd edition, p. 94.

They are **not** guaranteed to be fast.
