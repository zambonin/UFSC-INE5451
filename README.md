`q1_freq.py` will open any number of files given through arguments and print the sorted distribution of letter and digram frequencies.

```
chmod u+x q1_freq.py
./q1_freq.py foo.in bar.in
```
A free copy of Victor Hugo's _Les Miser√°bles_ in TXT format is included for testing purposes.

`q3_enigma.py` is a simple Enigma M3 implementation that doesn't consider a _Steckerbrett_ for debugging purposes. It's also lacking different component models such as rotors and 
reflectors. `q3_enig_breaker.py` will break a cyphered text that's long enough through a index of coincidence test. 

They are **not** guaranteed to be fast.
